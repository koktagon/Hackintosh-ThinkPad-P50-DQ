## macOS Monterey 12.7.6 - OpenCore 1.0.2 - Intel Core i7-6820HQ - Deutsche Qualit√§t

Untested:
- ExpressCard
- SmartCard
- Video outputs (HDMI and Mini-DP)

Not working:
- AirDrop + Handoff (use a real BCM94360NG card)
- Thunderbolt 3 (I didn't map the corresponding USB-C port for it as I don't have any use for it anyway)
- Nvidia Quadro M1000M/M2000M dGPU (the web driver is incompatible beyond High Sierra without OpenCore Legacy Patcher root patches)

SMBIOS is blanked on purpose, you need to provide your own, use 
[GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) for that
