- Thunderbolt 3 (I didn't map the corresponding USB-C port to begin with since I have no use for it anyway)
- Nvidia Quadro M1000M/M2000M dGPU (The web driver hasn't been supported beyond High Sierra without OCLP root patches)

SMBIOS is blanked on purpose, you need to provide your own, use 
[GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) for that (use a MacBookPro14,3 SMBIOS)
